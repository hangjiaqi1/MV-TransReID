Thanks for your attention. In this repo, we provide the code and dataset for the paper "MV-Reid: 3D Multi-View Transformation Network for Occluded Person Re-Identification".



# Open-source  schedule


**08 Oct 2023.** Open source the process of [3D reconstruction](https://github.com/hangjiaqi1/MV-TransReID/blob/main/3D%20reconstruction) and [multi-view rendering](https://github.com/hangjiaqi1/MV-TransReID/tree/main/Multi-view%20rendering)




 MV-TransReID source code and multi-view datasets will be open source after this paper is accepted.

 # Acknoledgements
 This paper and repo borrows codes and ideas from several great github repos: [MVTN](https://github.com/ajhamdi/MVTN), [hmr](https://github.com/layumi/hmr), and most importantly the great [Pytorch3D](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d) library.
